# !!!!!!!! UNLIKE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF PROCESSING !!!!!!!!!!
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE, OR DELETE SETTINGS FROM THIS FILE

# These are the default preferences. If you want to modify 
# them directly, use the per-user local version of the file:

# Documents and Settings -> [username] -> Application Data -> 
#    StartFP100 -> preferences.txt (on Windows XP)

# Users -> [username] -> AppData -> Roaming -> 
#    StartFP100 -> preferences.txt (on Windows Vista)

# ~/Library -> StartFP100 -> preferences.txt (on Mac OS X)

# ~/.startFP100 -> preferences.txt (on Linux)

# The exact location of your preferences file can be found at
# the bottom of the Preferences window inside StartFP100.

# Because AppData and Application Data may be considered 
# hidden or system folders on Windows, you'll have to ensure
# that they're visible in order to get at preferences.txt

# You'll have problems running Processing if you incorrectly 
# modify lines in this file.

# This file DOES NOT CONTAIN settings for autoformatter (A-Style).
# Look for the file "formatter.conf" and follow instructions at top.

export.application.platform.windows = true
export.application.platform.linux = true

# Disable saving of preferences.txt file (settings will not survive StartFP100 IDE reboot)
preferences.readonly = false

# If you don't want users to have their experiments default to 
# "My Documents/StartFP100" on Windows and "~/home/StartFP100" on Linux, 
# set this to another path that will be used by default. 
# Note that this path must exist already otherwise it won't see
# the experiments folder, and will instead assume the experiments
# has gone missing, and that it should instead use the default.
